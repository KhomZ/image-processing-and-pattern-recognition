Image Processing and Pattern Recognition

## [Digital Image Processing](IPPR/DIP)
Digital image processing is the use of a digital computer to process digital images through an algorithm.

## [Pattern Recognition](IPPR/PatternRecognition)
Pattern is everything around in this digital world. A pattern can either be seen physically or it can be observed mathematically by applying algorithms. 

Example: The colors on the clothes, speech pattern, etc. In computer science, a pattern is represented using vector feature values. 

## What is Pattern Recognition? 

Pattern recognition is the process of recognizing patterns by using a machine learning algorithm. 

Examples: Speech recognition, speaker identification, multimedia document recognition (MDR), automatic medical diagnosis.
